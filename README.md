# CS-405
Secure Coding

This repository contains the comprehensive coursework and projects for Southern New Hampshire University's CS405 - Secure Coding course. The curriculum is centered on the critical implementation of secure coding methodologies and developing a deep understanding of the various security vulnerabilities prevalent in software development. A central component of this work is the practical application of these principles through the development of the Green Pace Secure Development Policy.

Included within this repository is the complete Green Pace Developer Security Policy Guide Template. This foundational document provides a detailed framework for ensuring software security, encompassing mandated secure development practices, rigorous code review requirements, and systematic security testing procedures. Furthermore, the policy outlines robust protocols for ongoing vulnerability management and establishes clear guidelines for incident response, ensuring a proactive and structured approach to application security throughout the development lifecycle.
